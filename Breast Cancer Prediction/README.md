## Project Overview

Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and the second highest in terms of mortality rates.
Diagnosis of breast cancer is performed when an abnormal lump is found (from self-examination or x-ray) or a tiny speck of
calcium is seen (on an x-ray). After a suspicious lump is found, the doctor will conduct a diagnosis to determine whether
it is cancerous and, if so, whether it has spread to other parts of the body.

This breast cancer dataset was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.


## Data Description

diagnosis: The diagnosis of breast tissues (1 = malignant(cancerous), 0 = benign(non cancerous))
mean_radius: mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
mean_texture: standard deviation of gray-scale values
mean_perimeter: mean size of the core tumor
mean_area
mean_smoothness: mean of local variation in radius lengths

The main motive of our predictor is to correctly predict on the basis of the data available, if the breast cancer is

- Malignant(1) i.e. Harmful ,or
- Benign(0) i.e. Not Harmful.
Hence, our target class is Diagnosis


## Overview 

This project is divided into various parts:
- Data description and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Visualization
- Model Building
- Prediction
