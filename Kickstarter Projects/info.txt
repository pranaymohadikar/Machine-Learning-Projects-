I'm a crowdfunding enthusiast and i'm watching kickstarter since its early days. Right now I just collect data and the only app i've made is this twitter bot which tweet any project reaching some milestone: @bloomwatcher . I have a lot of other ideas, but sadly not enough time to develop themâ€¦ But I hope you can!

Content
You'll find most useful data for project analysis. Columns are self explanatory except:

usd_pledged: conversion in US dollars of the pledged column (conversion done by kickstarter).

usd pledge real: conversion in US dollars of the pledged column (conversion from Fixer.io API).

usd goal real: conversion in US dollars of the goal column (conversion from Fixer.io API).

Acknowledgements
Data are collected from Kickstarter Platform

usd conversion (usdpledgedreal and usdgoalreal columns) were generated from convert ks pledges to usd script done by tonyplaysguitar

Inspiration
I hope to see great projects, and why not a model to predict if a project will be successful before it is released? :)
